      title: "Application Continuum"
      description: >
        The Application Continuum is a spectrum of system architecture, showing the evolution of 
        a distributed system starting from a single application and evolving into several applications and 
        services. This tool will help you to make conscious design decisions and potentially reduce the cost 
        of changing code as the system needs to evolve. The continuum is language agnostic and applies to 
        any modern programming language, however, the provided examples will be all in Kotlin. So if you 
        like Kotlin, and enjoy a bit of monolith-vs-microservices discussion, please join us!

      title: "Introduction to Arrow"
      description: >
        Funktionale and Kategory have merged into Arrow, consolidating two of the most popular FP libraries in 
        the Kotlin space into one powerhouse. This talk is an introduction to some FP concepts, how the libraries 
        work, what features they bring to the table and where you might use them in your code.
